# PWA Installation Guide

Dialtone can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on your device for quick access and an app-like experience.

## Benefits of Installing as PWA

- **Quick Access**: Launch from your home screen with one tap

- **Offline Ready**: Works even without network connectivity (with service worker)
- **Automatic Updates**: Always get the latest version automatically

1. Open Dialtone in Chrome browser
2. Look for the "Install App" button in the header, or:
   - Tap the menu (three dots) in Chrome
   - Select "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"
3. Follow the prompts to install
4. Find Dialtone on your home screen

### iOS (Safari)

1. Open Dialtone in Safari
2. Tap the Share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Give it a name (default: "Dialtone")

### Desktop (Chrome/Edge)
